On **October 18, 2024**, I had the opportunity to present at the **Inclusion Done Right! Conference** held at **Stony Brook Universityâ€™s Charles B. Wang Center Theater**. This event showcased **innovative solutions for accessibility and inclusion**, with a focus on **Inclusion Done Right! The App**, a real-time, community-based tool designed to support individuals with disabilities and their caregivers.

This project exemplifies the power of **cross-disciplinary collaboration** in leveraging **technology for social impact**. The conference provided a platform to discuss how **engineering, AI, and health informatics** can drive innovative solutions for inclusion and accessibility.
