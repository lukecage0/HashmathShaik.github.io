abstract: 'We propose a novel method combining multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) with large language models (LLMs) to extract semantic relations from text. This hybrid approach enables high-accuracy information retrieval, especially in biomedical and social media text. Our experiments demonstrate that this method outperforms traditional NLP pipelines in extracting meaningful relationships from large-scale datasets.'
