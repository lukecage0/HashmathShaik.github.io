abstract: 'We present a symbolic knowledge graph framework that encodes key analog circuit design rules and topological relationships, enabling LLMs to generate more accurate circuit topologies. By incorporating structured domain knowledge, we achieve significant improvements in design precision and reduce errors common in existing automated circuit generation tools.'
