abstract: 'Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for automating problem-solving beyond traditional algorithmic approaches, which rely on static domain knowledge such as performance metrics and libraries of basic building blocks. LLMs can support open-ended problem solving by aiding in problem framing, exploring solving approaches, feature elaboration, implementation assessment, and handling unexpected situations. This report summarizes recent advancements in LLM applications, including model prompting, Reinforcement Learning, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation, and discusses future research directions in automated implementation generation.'
