I am a **Ph.D. student in Computer Engineering** at [Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu), working on **Neuro-Symbolic AI, Deep Learning, and Reinforcement Learning**. My research focuses on integrating deep learning techniques with symbolic reasoning to improve AI interpretability, efficiency, and adaptability in real-world applications.  

Prior to my Ph.D., I earned a **Master’s in Computer Science** from [Lakehead University, Canada](https://www.lakeheadu.ca/). During my time there, I worked at the [Problem-Oriented Medical Research Lab](https://www.lakeheadu.ca/users/M/mohammed/Problem_Oriented_Medical_Research), where I focused on **AI-driven clinical decision support systems**. I developed a **deep-learning-based Q&A system** using **LLMs** to assist healthcare professionals in retrieving **PICO-based clinical evidence**, improving decision-making in medical research.

Alongside my research in **NLP, distributed systems, and optimization methods**, I built expertise in **large-scale AI applications** and **medical AI solutions**. Before that, I completed my **Bachelor’s in Information Technology** from JNTUK, India, where I gained a strong foundation in **data structures, databases, and operating systems**.

### **Research Interests**
My primary research interests lie at the intersection of **Neuro-Symbolic AI, Deep Learning, and Reinforcement Learning**, with applications in **healthcare AI, robotics, and multi-agent systems**. I am particularly interested in:
- **Multi-Modal AI** – Integrating NLP, speech processing, and vision to create adaptive AI systems.
- **Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning** – Merging deep learning with structured symbolic representations for improved AI generalization.
- **Explainable AI (XAI)** – Using causal tracing and symbolic techniques to improve AI interpretability.
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL) & Multi-Agent Systems** – Enhancing team collaboration in autonomous systems.

### **Looking for Collaborations**
I am always open to collaborations in **Neuro-Symbolic AI, Reinforcement Learning, and NLP**.
